Accounting Ledger App Summary

In my project I created a Ledger application that gives you multiple options 
on how to handle your funds.

1. The Main Screen - 
Displays if you would like to make a deposit, make a payment, or view the ledger screen.

2. Deposit Screen - Ask for the deposit info and once you complete filling it out it saves it to the csv file.

3. Payment Screen - Ask for payment info and once you complete filling it out it saves it to the csv file.

4. Ledger Screen - Gives you multiple options, you can view all transactions that were made, or you can view what type of transaction was made as well as when it was made.
